     <h1><i>Syria: Before the Conflict (Part I)</i></h1>
     <p>I was only eight when my family and I took a two week holiday to the beautiful Middle-East and more specifically, Syria. I have travelled a fair amount and Syria is probably the most beautiful place I have seen in my whole life. We originally flew into the capital and main city of Damascus. The ancient capital and the home of the invention of Damascus steel. There are such sites as the beautiful Umayyad Mosque with incredibly hot stone tiles in the main courtyard and of course you can’t wear shoes in the Mosque. With the Mosque is the mausoleum of the famous warrior and conqueror Saladin. He is held highly in Syrian and Egyptian culture because of his victories over the crusaders from Europe in Palestine.<br><br>

     The next place is the Souq. This beautiful, arched, indoor market is full of vibrant colours, smells and especially tastes. The foods there are drool-worthy. Shelves of neat square baklava, spices from all across Asia, and especially, the world famous ice-cream parlour, ‘Bakdash’. This shop, founded in 1885, uses it’s very own ancient technique of pounding ice-cream with a large wooden hammer to combine the milk, gum and orchid flour. The product is a Turkish style ice cream rolled in pistachio with a delicious taste.<br><br>

     After Damascus, we moved on to the beautiful city of Aleppo. Aleppo is in the north of the country and is home to some of the most prized ancient buildings in all of Syria. From beautiful old city to the museums full of treasures and spoils of the ancient arab conflicts. All of this is topped off by the picturesque citadel in the very centre of the city. Standing tall and proud with its tall towers and gorgeous walls. From here you can look across the city and see all the proud standing minarets and mosque domes along the skyline of the city. Another part of Aleppo that I would greatly recommend is to walk around some portion of the walls. It grants a great way to see around lots of the city as well as being able to turn 180 degrees and see the vast desert beyond.<br><br>

     From Aleppo, we made a short trip to the famous Krak des Chevaliers. This crusader castle was first under control of Kurdish troops using it as a tactical stronghold. It has passed over hands many times in recent years but when it is not in a war zone, it makes for a beautiful site to visit. The castle stands tall on its hill, clearly an impenetrable base, a proud mark on this otherwise barren landscape. One precaution I would advise is that there are little to no precautions to prevent you     from falling off the steep walls to a perilous demise, so be careful when navigating the higher regions of the castle.
