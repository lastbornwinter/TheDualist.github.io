    <h1><i>Catalonia: The current situation</i></h1>
    <p>Some people may already know a lot about the current affairs in Catalonia, but it ' s a fairly complicated situation. Catalonia is on the Franco-Spanish peninsula in the north-east of Spain and in the 15th century, the County of Barcelona was part of Aragon, thus when King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile married and their kingdoms were united, it formed the land of Spain. The area remained a strong part of Spain and was well connected  up until the 19th century. In this period there was a sudden surge of Catalan identity with the region becoming more independent and attempting to revive the dying language of Catalan. The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco took the city of Barcelona in 1939 during the Franco-Spanish war, signifying the end a hard fought resistance campaign. Under Franco ’ s rule, the city was dictated under heavy spanish nationalism. Catalan was restricted and the autonomy that had been built up was torn down.<br><br>

You might be asking, why does this affect now? Catalan has been building and pushing for greater autonomy (self proficiency) for a long time. They hold 20% of Spain ' s GDP and this is including the taxes they pay to the National Government. On top of this Catalonia accounts for 25% of Spanish exports with only 16% of Spain’s population. The only downside of this being that 33.5% of Catalan exports are currently exported to other regions of Spain. The reason all of this matters is that the regional President of Catalonia called for a referendum to be help on October the 1st as to whether Catalonia should become a separate nation to Spain. The referendum has now taken place and the results are in with 80% of voters voting to separate from Spain. The only issue with this result is that only 40% of the population turned out to vote.<br><br>

If you were wondering why the turn-out was only 40%, it could be something to do with the Guardia Civil. The Guardia Civil is the national police in Spain, imposed in 1844 by Queen Isabel II. It came after the decision that there may be a need to ‘ deploy infantry and cavalry forces under the maintenance of law and order. ’ Well during this month’s referendum, the Guardia Civil were called onto the streets of Catalonian towns, dispersing protesters and closing down polling stations. Rubber bullets were fired into crowds of protesters or voters injuring at least 700 people including elderly citizens. Images of bleeding and hurt innocents horrified many around the world.<br><br>

There is much debate as to whether it is a good idea for catalonia to become independent. Nobody knows if they would be accepted into the European Union and a conflict between neighbouring nations in the heart of Europe could spark full scale war. There is one thing for certain however, these people certainly deserve to vote on what they believe in without being shot at or hurt.
