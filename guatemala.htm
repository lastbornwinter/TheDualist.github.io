       <h1><i>Guatemala: A forgotten culture</i></h1>
       <p>I travelled to Guatemala some years ago when I was much younger, and we all know how much more vibrant everything seems from the eyes of a child. We originally landed in Guatemala City. As well as being a beautiful city from the sky, it is the city with the 25th highest homicide rates in the world and is struggling to tackle a huge drug problem. It was these reasons combined with a few others that we left the city after one night there. We arrived back at the airport that we landed in after only a few hours on the ground and after a small admin technicality, we were back in the air. This time flying to the beautiful Lago de Izabal.<br><br>

       The lake itself was amazing and as we arrived at our hotel (called Finca Izabal) we felt fully immersed in our stunning surroundings. We stayed at Finca Izabal for a couple of nights, mainly relaxing and taking in a bit of Guatemalan culture. During our time there, we caught a boat down to the small coastal town of Livingstone. This was an immediate culture shock. We were no longer on the latin streets of a central american country, but on the streets of a small town in Jamaica. Due to it’s geographical location, Livingstone has a majority population of Caribbean people. You can buy plantains and eat local foods and even visit the waterfalls, surrounded by shrines to Bob Marley, and no, that’s not a joke.<br>
