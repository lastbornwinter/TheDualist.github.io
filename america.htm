     <h1><i>America: How to Win an Election in the Twenty-Tens</i></h1>
     <p>America is arguably the most love/ hated country in the world. They are so politically divided that they will ‘happily’ elect their first ever black president and follow that up by electing an economically motivated and, regarded by some as racially prejudiced, white male. They are keen to spend $597 billion on a military and $18.4 billion on  a world class Aeronautics and Space administration. The funny part is that the latter probably accounted for more in the cold war.<br><br>

      There has been much in the press about the current POTUS since his election in early November 2016 and this has had many mixed responses. He led a famous political campaign through the online media service ‘Twitter’ with some very questionable posts, these including the likes of<br> ‘Despite the constant negative press covfefe’ and<br> ‘Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!’. On top of this, not quite Trump but his originally appointed Press Secretary posted ‘n9y25ah7’ which with no other explanation, led many to believe he genuinely posted his password.<br><br>

      This may all sound bad but ultimately, he won his campaign and many put this down to his utilisation of modern media. Even if you don’t like him, you at the very least know about him and this is mostly down to him managing to put himself everywhere. What the many at Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post don’t care for when they write articles attempting to slander or denounce him, is that they are ultimately giving him more coverage. If you have ever heard the expression, ‘Any press is good press’ this is what Mr Trump lives his life by. Tweets are designed to be eye catching and offer relatively no explanation to the topic you bring up. Their 160 character limit does not encourage discussion but only allows a user to voice the tip of the iceberg that is their opinion. Even if you decide to comment on a tweet and try to start a discussion, it has to be limited. What this leads to is a bold celebrity opinion to stand at the top, followed by a wave of comments either saying ‘Yes is agree’ or ‘No I hate you’.<br><br>

      A key way in which this tactic of brief explanation can be capitalised on (and was last year) is that you then get many people watching your debates, speeches and interviews in the following days, longing for that explanation which you never offer. People are constantly on the edge of their seat, compelled by the prospect of an answer to all the questions of their late night Twitter scrolling. An answer that they never receive.<br><br>

      His rallies are always filled, his interviews and speeches always viewed across the US and his fame amplified. These can definitely be considered to be reasons leading to his success in 2016 and possibly, his future success.<br>
